As a user, I want to add a to-do list because I want it to remind what to do later.
As a user, I should be able to remove a todo item, because I have completed it.
As a user, I want it to categorize my to-dos automatically because I don't have time to organize my todos.
As a user, I want to be able to change a category of a to-do, if I don't feel it belongs there.
As a user, if I have a todo that doesn't belong in one of the categories, I should be able to edit it.

As a user, I shouldn't be able edit someone else todo list, because it is not my todo list.
